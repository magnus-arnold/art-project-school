        This website is for my art project. You have to find the words in the images, as seen below
        in the image. Once you have found one of the words, you'll be taken to the next image. To view
        the puzzle pieces you've found, and to assemble them to finish, go <a href="puzzlepieceindex.html">here</a>.
