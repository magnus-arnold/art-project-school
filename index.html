        This website is for my art project. You have to find the words in the images, as seen below
        in the image. Once you have found one of the words, you'll be taken to the next image, and
        once you have found all of the words, go <a href="puzzlepieceindex.html">here</a> to assemble them. You can 
        also view your currently found pieces and select them there.
